When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - Collaborating on a project with others and to work on a project from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - If your remote repository is public or shared, someone could make changes that you do
   not want.  Having control over pulling those new commits protects your local repository.
