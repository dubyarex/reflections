When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - Collaborating on a project with others and to work on a project from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - If your remote repository is public or shared, someone could make changes that you do
   not want.  Having control over pulling those new commits protects your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?
 - Forks are clones of other GitHub repositories.  It give you the ability to use a
   repository originally made by someone else.  You can edit the clone without changing
   the original repository, but there is still a link crediting the original repository
   and owner.
 - Clones are duplicates of a local or remote repository onto your local machine.
 - Branches are named paths inside of a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 - So you can work on it offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what
would be harder?
 - Using shared drive or cloud storage or emailing .zip files back and forth.
 - Not much would be easier.
